<h1 align="center">threads</h1>

Version 1.0 - Work in progress ðŸ› 

Here you can find a complete rewrite of the `threads` library.

Comes with a new robust API, it's all functional, and all statically typed. It's still fully isomorphic - run the same code in the browser, in node.js or an electron app!

Development progress is tracked in ðŸ‘‰ [#100](https://github.com/andywer/threads.js/issues/100). Feel free to leave feedback there!

## Installation

Not yet published to npm.

## Compatibility

#### Platform: Web (browsers)

Use [web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API).

#### Platform: Node.js 12+

Use native [worker threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html).

#### Platform: Node.js < 12

Use [`tiny-worker`](https://github.com/avoidwork/tiny-worker) as fallback if native worker threads are not available.

## New Paradigm

Full focus on worker code in their own files instead of inline functions.
Running inlined functions in a worker was nice for concise code samples, but offered limited value in real-world applications.

That also means we are focussing on usage with bundlers like Webpack or Parcel, since this is the main use case anyway. We shall have worker code with working `import`/`require()` that works as is in node.js as well as bundled in browsers.

## Usage

### Concept

```js
// master.js
import { spawn, Thread, Worker } from "threads"

const add = await spawn(new Worker("./workers/add"))
const sum = await add(2, 3)

console.log(`2 + 3 = ${sum}`)

await Thread.terminate(sum)
```

```js
// workers/add.js
import { expose } from "threads/worker"

expose(function add(a, b) {
  return a + b
})
```

#### spawn()

The return value of `add()` in the master code depends on the `add()` return value in the worker:
If the function returns a promise or an observable then you can just use the return value as such in the master code. If the function returns a primitive value, expect the master function to return a promise resolving to that value.

#### expose()

You can `expose()` either a function or an object. In case of exposing an object, `spawn()` will asynchronously return an object exposing all the object's functions, following the same rules as functions directly `expose()`-ed.

### Code Samples

<details>
<summary>Basics - Function thread</summary>

```js
// master.js
import { spawn, Thread, Worker } from "threads"

const fetchGithubProfile = await spawn(new Worker("./workers/fetch-github-profile"))
const andywer = await fetchGithubProfile("andywer")

console.log(`User "andywer" has signed up on ${new Date(andywer.created_at).toLocaleString()}`)

await Thread.terminate(fetchGithubProfile)
```

```js
// workers/fetch-github-profile.js
import fetch from "isomorphic-fetch"
import { expose } from "threads/worker"

expose(async function fetchGithubProfile(username) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}`)
  return response.json()
})
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Basics - Module thread</summary>

```js
// master.js
import { spawn, Thread, Worker } from "threads"

const counter = await spawn(new Worker("./workers/counter"))
await counter.increment()
await counter.increment()
await counter.decrement()

console.log(`Counter is now at ${await counter.getCount()}`)

await Thread.terminate(counter)
```

```js
// workers/counter.js
import { expose } from "../../src/worker"

let currentCount = 0

const counter = {
  getCount() {
    return currentCount
  },
  increment() {
    return ++currentCount
  },
  decrement() {
    return --currentCount
  }
}

expose(counter)
```

<details>
<summary>TODO: Basics - Returning observables</summary>

Just return an observable in your worker, subscribe to it in the master code. Fully transparent.
</details>

<details>
<summary>TODO: Basics - Error handling</summary>

Fully transparent. The promise in the master code's call will be rejected with the error thrown in the worker, also yielding the worker error's stack trace.

### Usage with node.js

Works out of the box. Note that we wrap the native `Worker`, so `new Worker("./foo/bar")` will resolve the path relative to the module that calls it, not relative to the current working directory.

That aligns it with the behavior when bundling the code with webpack or parcel.

### Usage with Webpack

Use with the [`worker-plugin`](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/worker-plugin), so all `new Worker("./unbundled-path")` expressions are detected and properly transformed transparently, so you don't need to explicitly use the `worker-loader` or define extra entry points.

TODO

### Usage with Parcel

Should work out of the box without any extra plugins.

The only adjustment you need to do is to import `threads/register` once in the beginning (in the master code, not in the thread) to register the library's `Worker` for your platform as the global `Worker`.

This is necessary, since you cannot `import { Worker } from "threads"` or Parcel won't recognize `new Worker()` as a web worker anymore.

## API

TODO

## Debug

We are using the [`debug`](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) package to provide opt-in debug logging. All the package's debug messages have a scope starting with `threads:`, with different sub-scopes.

Set it to `DEBUG=threads:*` to enable all the library's debug logging. To run its tests with full debug logging, for instance:

```
DEBUG=threads:* npm test
```
